## Progress
- Can create a match
- Can enter lobby
- Can play worlds! (most enemy objects do not work because of the 0xA0 trigger)
- Can load worlds from server and client alike
- Can somewhat broad player state
## TODO
- Load worlds from world without editing config file
- Save config to MarioRoyaleSocket and update when the file updates
- Implement maintenance functionality
