# mroyale-server-new
Port project of the Mario Royale backend server in node.js
## Progress
- Can create a match
- Can enter lobby
- Fixed player count from last commit
- Cannot play worlds (need to add config)
- Can display P/V/T on top right of lobby properly
- Can send player information (name, skin, isDev)
- Can have isDev flag (as long as name matches, but when accounts get done it should use client name instead.)
