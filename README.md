# mroyale-server-new
Port project of the Mario Royale backend server in node.js
## Progress
- Can create a match
- Can enter lobby
- Fixed player count from last commit
- Can play worlds! (most enemy objects do not work because of the 0xA0 trigger)
- Can display P/V/T on top right of lobby properly
- Can send player information (name, skin, isDev)
- Can have isDev flag (as long as name matches, but when accounts get done it should use client name instead.)
- Can auto-start worlds
- Can play gamemodes
- Can randomly choose worlds
- Players can now join the same match (next: serialize player object)
